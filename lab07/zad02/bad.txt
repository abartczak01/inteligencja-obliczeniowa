I checked in and checked out in ten mins. Horrific!

The bed was broken, sheets were dirty, walls were mouldy, windows were rotting, furniture was broken and absoloutely not fit for use. The room was tiny and the floorboards were trying to come through the wafer thin carpet.

Upon check in the lady in the window was rude and the smell through out the property was absoloutely repulsive.

AVOID THIS PROPERTY, IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN AND CONDEMED!!!
